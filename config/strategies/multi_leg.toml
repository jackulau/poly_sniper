# Multi-Leg Correlated Market Strategy Configuration

# This strategy identifies and trades correlated positions across related markets,
# such as election outcomes where results in one market imply results in another.

# Example: Mutually Exclusive Markets
# These markets represent outcomes that cannot all be true simultaneously.
# The sum of YES token prices should equal 1.0 (or expected_sum).

# Example: Inverse Correlation
# Markets that move in opposite directions.
# If A goes up, B should go down, and vice versa.
# For binary elections: A YES + B YES should sum close to 1.0
#
# [[strategy.correlation_rules]]
# name = "Biden vs Trump Inverse"
# relationship = "inverse"
# expected_sum = "1.0"

# market_id = "trump-wins-2024"
# token = "Yes"
# weight = "1.0"

# Example: Conditional/Implied Markets
# A implies B: If A happens, B must happen.
# Example: "Biden wins" implies "Democrat wins"
# So Biden YES price should always be <= Democrat YES price.
#
# [[strategy.correlation_rules]]
# name = "Biden implies Democrat Victory"
# relationship = "conditional"
# tolerance = "0.01"

# [[strategy.correlation_rules.legs]]
# # First leg is the antecedent (the specific outcome)
# market_id = "biden-wins-2024"
# token = "Yes"
# weight = "1.0"
#
# [[strategy.correlation_rules.legs]]
# # Second leg is the consequent (the implied outcome)
# market_id = "democrat-wins-2024"
# token = "Yes"
# weight = "1.0"

# Example: Sequential Events
# "Will X happen by March?" implies "Will X happen by December?"
# Earlier date YES price should be <= later date YES price.
